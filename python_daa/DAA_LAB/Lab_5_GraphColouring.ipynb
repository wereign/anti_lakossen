    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "> We are given an undirected graph and m number of different colored_verticess. We have to check if we can assign colored_verticess to the vertices of the graphs in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same colored_vertices.\n",

    "- Generate all possible combinations of colored_verticess on the vertices\n",
    "- After generating the configuration, check if any adjacent vertices have the same colored_vertices or not.\n",
    "- If they do have the same colored_vertices, skip the combination.\n",
    "- If they donot have the same colored_vertices, the return the combination and break the loop.\n",
