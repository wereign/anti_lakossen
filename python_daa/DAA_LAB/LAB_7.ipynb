    "> To solve write a program for Prim's Algorithm using python\n",
    "## PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "> Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "1. A minimum weight spanning is **subset of the edges of a connected**, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles with the minimum possible total edge weight.\n",
    "2. Prim’s algorithm always starts with a single node and it moves through several adjacent nodes, in order to explore all of the connected edges along the way.\n",
    "3. It starts with an empty spanning tree. The idea is to maintain two sets of vertices. \n",
    "- The first set contains the vertices already included in the MST, the other set contains the vertices not yet included. \n",
    "- At every step, it considers all the edges that connect the two sets and picks the minimum weight edge from these edges. \n",
    "- After picking the edge, it moves the other endpoint of the edge to the set containing MST\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST. \n",
    "2. Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key values as INFINITE. Assign the key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first. \n",
    "3. While mstSet doesn’t include all vertices \n",
    "- Pick a vertex u which is not there in mstSet and has a minimum key value. \n",
    "- Include u in the mstSet. \n",
    "- Update the key value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the key values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if the weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, update the key value as the weight of u-v"
